# Markdown link parser in Go

This is a Go-written version of my [markdown parser in Python](https://github.com/paveltovchigrechko/markdown-parser). Although, most modern static site generators check anchor links, some of them still do not perform this check. And, this is educational project for me as well.

## Build

To be written.

## Usage

Intended usage:

```shell
[binary] [directory-root] [options]
```
